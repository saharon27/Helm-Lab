# An Umbrella chart lab

This repo contains an hands-on lab about Umbrella chart with helm3.
This lab is based on the great helm tutorial by David Campos that is published here:
https://hands-on-tech.github.io/2020/03/15/k8s-jenkins-example.html

At the end of this lab you will have a full umbrella chart that will deploy a full deployment
consist of Traefik, k8s dashboard, jenkins server and a small Chuck Norris web page with random joke.

In the lab-charts folder you will find all the charts that we are going to work on.
In the solved folder you can find the end result we want to achieve.

### Requirements

1. single node k8s cluster (minikube or similar is good enough).
1. kubectl
1. helm3
